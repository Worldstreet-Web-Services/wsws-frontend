// sponsored batch, so the sponsor signs once, needs no ETH for gas, and no
// allowance is ever left sitting between two transactions.
//
// None of the values are derived here. The bytes32 listing id, the token, the
// amount in minor units and a deadline inside the contract's accepted window
// all come from the service, which already enforces the rules the contract
// checks. Re-deriving them client-side would be a second implementation of
// those rules, and any drift shows up as a deposit the wallet rejects.
