/**
 * The Market Square page: the Square's own Home, inside this app, drawn as
 * the Square draws it.
 *
 * Home is a column in a fixed order, and this is that column in that order:
 * the search row and the gistroom banner, then "Top GistRooms", "Make some
 * friends", "Coming Soon", "Popular Houses" and "Post For You", each with
 * its two-tone heading and its "View more" into the Square. Each section
 * reads the same route Home reads and shows what it returns, on the Square's
 * own cards; each renders nothing when it has nothing. Home's "Suggested
 * pals" foot and its ecosystem partners rail are not here: the first is the
 * people deck again, the second is the Square's own marketing.
 *
 * Gated on MARKET_SQUARE_HIDDEN only, the rail entry's switch: a hidden
 * square has no page, and renders nothing here the way the entry renders
 * nothing there. SQUARE_SECTIONS_HIDDEN is the portfolio's switch and is not
 * read; this page is the answer to why those sections were turned off.
 * Decision record: docs/adr/ADR-2026-09-12-square-page-in-app.md.
