# Plan: the Market Square page at `/square`

On `feat/square-page`, cut from `origin/staging`. Decision:
`docs/adr/ADR-2026-09-12-square-page-in-app.md` and its companion.

The maintainer's direction on 2026-09-12, given while the page was being
built: the page is the Square's Home drawn as the Square draws it, its
styling and its UX, not a version in this app's language. So the sections,
headings, pills, cards, glyphs, fonts and exports come across from
`market-square-frontend` (`components/layout/home-screen.tsx` and the section
and card components beside it), and only the data layer is this app's: the
relay, the fetchers, the query hooks. The ADR's "app's own cards" wording is
superseded by that direction and should be amended when the ADR is next
touched.

## Contracts

- Streams are read with the session (`authedGet`): the relay demands one on
  `streams`, and the page sits under the auth guard. Profiles, houses, the
  feed and the topic vocabulary are public reads, as they are upstream.
- Every "do more" control is an anchor through `lib/square/links.ts` with
  `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`: Join Gistroom and Remind me to
  `live/{id}`, the wink and the photo to `u/{username}`, Join House to
  `houses/{id}`, the post's arrow to `p/{id}`, Host Room to
  `gist-rooms?open=1`, a search to `discover?q=`, and each View more to the
  Square's matching page.
- The page gates on `MARKET_SQUARE_HIDDEN` only, and renders nothing while it
  is set, the same answer the rail entry gives. `SQUARE_SECTIONS_HIDDEN` is
  the portfolio's switch and is not read.
- The reader's own profile is left out of "Make some friends", by the id
  `fetchSquareMe` returns. Passing takes a card off the rail for the visit.
