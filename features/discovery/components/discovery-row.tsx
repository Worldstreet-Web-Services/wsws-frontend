// One shelf of the dashboard's discovery area: a heading that is itself the way
// through to the service, and whatever cards the caller lays out beneath it.
// The heading font is the designer's Quicksand, used nowhere else.
//
// A long locale wraps the heading rather than pushing the chevron off the row.
// Two things hold that together. The title takes `min-w-0`, so it can shrink
// under the row's cap instead of standing at the width of its longest word and
// carrying the chevron out past the edge, and `break-words` then breaks a word
// too long to fit a line on its own. The chevron never shrinks, and the 6px
// between it and the title is a gap on the box, so a heading that has wrapped
// to two lines keeps exactly the same distance from the chevron as a heading
// that fits on one.
//
// Hover is `ws-pressable` and nothing else: the whole link lifts, chevron
// included. No shadow, and no second treatment layered on top of it.
