 * does not. Posts follow it, a whole section down and three sections clear of
 * the full feed at the bottom — near enough the top to be seen, far enough
 * from the real feed that the two are not read as the same shelf twice.
 * People sit mid-page. Each block renders nothing when it has nothing, so a
 * quiet deployment simply closes back up.
