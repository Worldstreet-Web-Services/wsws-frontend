// ("View Chart" to "Close Chart", "View Market Metrics" to "Close Market

// side, chart open, metrics open. This component is the shared surface plus the
// main state, and the other three states arrive through the `chart`, `metrics`

// mounted throughout, because the panel it is handed folds itself shut and

        {/* The list panel is sized by whole rows. The design's 682px is a floor
            here, not a cap, and nothing inside it scrolls. A fixed 682px box
            with the rows scrolling inside it sliced a row in half: 641px of room
            is 11.2 rows of 57px, so the twelfth row was cut by the panel's edge.
            It could also push the pagination bar out of the frame whenever the
            stale-prices strip appeared. The panel now ends on a row boundary in
            every state, and the bar is always in view.

            `self-stretch` fills the column. The desk is as tall as the window
            now (the route sets that, and the two `grow` boxes above pass it
            down), so the card ends at the foot of the page instead of stopping
            short with black showing underneath. The rail still hugs its own
            content; only the list stretches. Same shape as the spot market list,
            which the two tables are meant to share.

            The 682px floor survives the stretch and does not fight it, because
            both are minimums and the taller one simply wins. Past a window of
            roughly 880px the stretch is already beyond 682 and the floor is
            inert. Below that, on a 768px laptop say, the floor is what holds the
            design's frame, so the card keeps its ten rows rather than shrinking
            to the window. And with no desk height at all, which is what the
            server renders until useIsMobile corrects on a phone, it is still the
            only thing holding the panel up: without it a two-result search
            collapses the card to the height of its two rows.

            Nothing crops, because the count gives way instead of the panel. The
            stale-prices strip is the case that used to push the panel past its
            floor: it takes 43.5px off the rows block, so on a 700px window the
            block measures 533.75px and the page is nine rows rather than ten.
            The bar stays in view and the ninth row stays whole.

            The page size follows that height rather than staying at the ten the
            comp was drawn at. In a 1200px window the rows block measures
            894.25px, and ten rows fill 570 of it: the other 324px was empty
            card between the last row and the pager, which is what it reads as
            on screen, a black band above the bar. Fifteen rows fit, and fifteen
            is what the board now asks the caller to page at.
            The board measures the rows block and reports the count through
            `onPageSizeChange`, and the route pages at what it is told.

            The cost is that opening the chart or the metrics disclosure in the
            rail can repaginate the list, because the rail is what the panel
            stretches to once it is taller than the window. Rows move under the
            reader and "Page 2 of 5" changes meaning. The empty band was the
            louder defect of the two, and the pager is still honest about where
            the reader is; the spot list holds its nine because its panel is the
            taller of the two columns to begin with, so there was nothing to
            gain there. */}

              this box is left with `flex-1` against a header and a pager of
              fixed height and takes exactly the panel's spare space. Adding a
              row cannot make the box the count is read from any taller.

              Nothing weaker holds. `grow` alone leaves the flex basis at the
              rows' own height. `flex-1` zeroes the basis, but every box above
              this one up to the route is a min-height, so the panel's height is
              still indefinite, and a basis-zero item in an indefinite column is
              sized by its content all the same: measured in Chrome, a window
              dragged from 1200px down to 700px kept fifteen rows and left the
              panel 959px tall inside a 700px window. In the layer the rows
              cannot prop anything open, and the same drag settles at 682px and
              ten rows.

              `overflow-hidden` is the backstop, not the mechanism. The count is
              floored and the list is cut to it, so the rows drawn always fit the
              height they were counted from and there is nothing to clip. */}
