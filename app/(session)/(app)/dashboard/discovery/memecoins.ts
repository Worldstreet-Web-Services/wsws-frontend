 * and its warnings, and the user picked it. Here there is room for a symbol and
 * a big green number and nothing else. So the rule is that the card only
 * promotes what it can promote honestly:
 *
 * - `buyEnabled === false`: the service will not sell it, so the card would be
 *   sending people to a coin they cannot buy.
 * - HIGH or CRITICAL `riskLevel`: promoting a coin the service's own risk
 *   engine has flagged, with the flag stripped off, is us making the
 *   recommendation. It stays reachable at the desk, with its badge attached.
 * - Any warning left after `visibleWarnings`: if the card cannot show the
 *   caveat it does not show the coin. `visibleWarnings` first drops the
 *   upgradeable-proxy flag, which nearly every serious token carries.
 *
 * UNKNOWN risk is allowed, and that is a deliberate concession rather than an
 * oversight. `/tokens/trending` omits the risk block entirely and
 * `withRiskDefaults` fills it with UNKNOWN and no warnings, so excluding
 * UNKNOWN would empty this card on the normal path and leave the exclusions
 * biting only on the catalogue fallback. Allowing it keeps the card live while
 * still dropping every coin that is actually flagged.

 * when it is down `fetchTrendingTokens` falls back to a page of the catalogue,
 * which is not ranked at all. Neither ordering matches a heading that promises
 * 100X, so the gainers are put in front.
 *

 * artwork for are held a slot in it rather than being left to reach the top
 * five on their own, which they almost never do. Both are changes to which
 * coins are in the row. The order is still the 24h move and nothing else, so a
 * held coin sits where its own number puts it. See `holdFeaturedSlots`.
 *
 * A held slot cannot conjure a coin that is not in the feed. The trending
 * upstream is a live discovery feed of new listings, and on most days it
 * carries neither SHIB nor PEPE, so the card still has to have something to
 * show when its artwork never comes up.
 *
 * Losers are not filtered out, only pushed to the back. On a red day the card
 * shows the best moves there actually were, coloured honestly by `up`, which is
 * why the shape carries that flag at all. Hiding a red market would leave the
 * row blank on exactly the days people are looking at it.

 * failed, or nothing in the page cleared the exclusions: the card falls back to
 * its committed illustration.
