// The dashboard's balance, fetched on the server for the session that asked
// and handed to the browser as a dehydrated query cache. usePortfolio then
// finds its data already there under the key it would have built itself,
// ["portfolio", evm, solana], and paints the number instead of a skeleton.
//
// Before this the balance sat four network hops behind the first paint: the
// bundle, then Privy's own start-up, then its /users/me call for the identity
// token, then /api/portfolio, which itself verified the token and called
// Alchemy. Every hop was serial. Here the server already holds the session
// cookie, so it resolves the user and the balance while the HTML is still
// being written.
//
// Per request and per user by construction: the session comes from the
// cookie, the wallets from that user, and the result is never stored beyond
// the process cache fetchPortfolio already keeps per wallet pair. The route
// handler that serves /api/portfolio shares that cache, so the browser's first
// background refetch, a minute later, is answered from it.
//
// Never throws. A missing session, a user without wallets, or an Alchemy
// failure all yield a state the client treats as "nothing prefetched", and the
// browser fetches as it always did.
