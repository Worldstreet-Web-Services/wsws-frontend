  /**
   * The breaker sits at the ONE transport, not in each hook.
   *
   * This app polls harder than anything else we run — match state every
   * second, tickets every second, several of them deliberately continuing in
   * a hidden tab — and each of those requests is a serverless invocation. When
   * the gateway is down, none of that traffic can accomplish anything, so it
   * does not leave the tab at all: no network, no invocation, no cost.
   *
   * READS only. A write is the player doing something deliberate — a move, a
   * bet, a transfer — and refusing it in-process would look like it happened
   * when it did not. Those go out and fail honestly, and their failure still
   * informs the breaker.
