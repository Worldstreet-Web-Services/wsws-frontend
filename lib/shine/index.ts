// Shine: a confirmed action is posted to the user's Market Square, with no
// confirmation step and no button.
//
// This file is the whole surface a feature touches. A feature says "this
// happened, here are the facts" and stops. It does not know whether Shine is
// on, whether the post was already made, whether the square answered, or that
// a queue exists. reportShine returns void, never throws and never rejects, so
// no Shine failure can reach the trade that triggered it.
//
// WHERE THE PREFERENCE IS CHECKED, AND WHY HERE
//
// The gate is read inside reportShine, not by the seven call sites. The
// preference resolves asynchronously, so `isEnabled` has three answers, not
// two: on, off, and not known yet. Seven call sites is seven chances to write
// `?? true` or `!== false` and turn "not known yet" into a public post the
// user never agreed to. It is written once here, it is `=== true` or nothing,
// and one test covers every service.
//
// An unresolved preference is treated as OFF. The post that is not made can be
// made by hand; the post made against an unread preference cannot be taken
// back.
