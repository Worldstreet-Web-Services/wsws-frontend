                  One row, split evenly, in PerpOrderTicket's ActionButton
                  geometry: the same h-12, rounded-3xl, border-2, gap-2 and
                  16px semibold Inter as the Buy/Sell pair directly above, so
                  the two rows read as one family. NOT bg-buy or bg-sell. Those
                  two tokens mean "this places an order"; these move collateral,
                  and a green button that is not Buy sitting under Buy is the
                  worst thing this column could do. They take the neutral
                  surface tokens instead, filled for Top up and outlined for
                  Withdraw, which puts them a clear step below the saturated
                  pair without making either look disabled. */}
