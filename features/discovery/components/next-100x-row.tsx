// medallion is drawn as large as the dog rather than as a smaller disc beside
// the same heading.
//
// The width is capped at the drawing's own 255 and otherwise takes what the copy
// leaves, plus the overlap the artboard itself draws. The arithmetic:
//
//   copy block   242px of column plus its 16px right margin  = 258px
//   artboard     484px card less its 1.03px edge either side = 481.94px
//   overlap      255 + 258 - 481.94                          = 31.06px
//
// So the design's own composition already spends 31px of overlap: the dog's slot
// runs to 255 and the headline box starts at 252. Holding that figure rather
// than driving it to zero is what keeps the artboard's geometry exact. A card at
// or above the artboard's 484 gets the drawing at 255; below it the slot gives
// way so that the overlap never grows past the artboard's, because the copy
// carries the coin's name and its move and the artwork is decoration. It gives
// way only down to the floor below, and is not drawn at all under it.
//
// `min()` rather than a container query, so there is no breakpoint to keep in
// step with the copy's width and nothing that can resolve against the wrong
// container. The percentage is of the card's padding box, which is the same box
// the copy's own `max-w` is measured against.
//
// The ratio is the drawing's, so a narrow card gets a smaller dog and never a
// squashed one. It cannot do to the card's height what it did before: the width
// is capped at 255, and the slot is out of flow, so it contributes no height at
// any width. Card height is the copy block's business alone.
//
// `bottom-0` is measured from the card rather than from the copy. The Shiba is
// cut off at the foot of his box, and that cut only reads as the dog standing
// behind the card once it sits on the card's bottom edge, including on a locale
// whose wrapped heading has pushed the card past the floor.

// read it.
//
// The slot above shrinks without a floor, so on a narrow card it keeps handing
// back a smaller drawing until the drawing is a chip. The figure below is where
// that has to stop, and it is derived rather than chosen: it is the width at
// which the disc's right edge meets the copy column's left edge.
//
//   disc right   3.137cqw + 65.836cqw of the slot            = 0.68973 * slot

//   copy left    the 242px column and its 16px margin        = width - 258
//
//   0.68973 * (width - 226.94) = width - 258   ->   width = 327.05
//
// Above it the whole picture stands in space the copy does not claim. Below it
// the disc starts printing into the column, and since the disc grows upward from
// the card's foot, a disc that is into the column is a disc that is into the
// heading. That is the overlap the redesign already had to fix once, so the line
// is drawn where it stops being possible rather than where it starts to look bad.
//
// It lands in the same place as legibility, arrived at separately: the ticker is
// 20% of the disc inside its border, so a card at the floor sets it at 12px and
// any narrower card sets it smaller than that.
//
// So below the line the card carries no picture. It is not a smaller picture,
// because there is no room for one that is both clear of the copy and legible;
// it is the gradient, the two ray bursts and the copy, and the copy takes the
// width the artwork is no longer using. A card that reads as a copy-only variant
// is a card, and a 65px chip in the corner is a bug report.
//
// A container query rather than arithmetic in the width, because "the picture is
// not drawn here" is a different statement from "the picture is this wide" and
// should read as one. It is measured on the card, which is what the slot's own
// percentage is measured against, so the two agree whatever width the carousel

// it. A circle hides far more than that silhouette does, and a disc at the
// slot's full height is a circle 212 across in a slot 255 wide, sitting over
// exactly the corner the arrow was escaping into. Measured on a rendered card,
// the arrow paints 8282px inside it and the old disc left 601 of them showing,
// 7.3%. That is the tail and a sliver of the head, which is not a rising signal.
//
// So the disc is given the dog's own footprint instead:
//
//   diameter  the dog's drawn area, 22135px, as a circle  = 167.88px, 65.836cqw
//   left      8px, 3.137cqw, which puts its right edge on 175.9, where the
//             dog's own profile runs through the heights the arrow crosses
//   bottom    the slot's foot, where the dog is cut off
//
// That leaves 4398px showing, 53.1%, against the 57.8% the dog himself leaves.
// The remainder is the disc's own drop shadow dimming the arrow around its rim.
// So the arrow is not moved at all: it keeps the design's size, lean and offset,
// and stays behind the picture. The disc also keeps the dog's ink rather than
// his bounding box, so a coin the design ships no drawing for is still drawn as
// large as he is.
//
// Only the disc. Bespoke art is a drawing with a silhouette of its own and the
// artboard already accounts for it: the Pepe portrait at the slot's full height
// leaves 98.1% of the arrow showing, because the arrow's ribbon runs just
// outside the portrait's rim. Moving that one would take legibility away, so
// COIN_BOX above is untouched and every drawing keeps the design's composition.
//
// Sized in the slot's own width for the same reason the arrow is, so the disc

          column shoved against the right edge of an empty one. It only ever
