/**
 * The migration as a gate: an overlay nobody can close until the old account
 * is linked and its CORE money — native, the stablecoins, KSH — has crossed.
 *
 * Deliberately not "every last token". A memecoin that reverts on transfer, a
 * perp position awaiting settlement, a market awaiting resolution — none of
 * those should hold the whole app shut. They are the long tail, and the
 * account menu keeps an always-open door to them ("Move money from old
 * wallet"). The gate is for the money a user would be hurt to leave behind.
 *
 * "Core cleared" is the panel's own on-chain discovery, not the service's
 * flag, which also fires while a ledger re-key is pending — a backend queue
 * the user cannot act on.
