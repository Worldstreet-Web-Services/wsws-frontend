// "Your Next Prediction Starts Here": two open markets, both leading to the
// prediction desk.
//
// The yellow card is the live one. It cycles through `markets` on a ten second
// timer, taking the countdown, the question, the collage and the first pill's
// destination from whichever market is up, and dropping the editorial tip that
// was written for the sample. Everything else on the card is fixed geometry
// and artwork. With no markets it renders the design's own sample: the fixed
// countdown, the Benny Hinn question and the two committed photos, which is
// what the preview harness and the tests see, and what ships until a markets
// feed reaches the dashboard.
//
// Every clickable on the row is a `DiscoveryCta` or the heading link, and both
// take their hover from `ws-pressable`. Nothing on these cards declares a hover
// of its own, and nothing carries a shadow at rest or on hover.
//
// The pair rides a carousel, and two cards cannot cycle, so the market card is
// dealt twice. It is the only card on the row carrying a clock, so it is the
// one the heading's "next" actually refers to; the title fight has no deadline
// on it. The repeat is third rather than second so the first two views are both
// a genuine pair. Both copies show the same market, which is the one card
// twice, as it has always been on this row.

  // than five seconds, so it needs a way to stop. Hover and focus-within on the
  // card are it. The hold is a count rather than a flag because the card is on
  // the row twice and the carousel clones its slides, so several copies can
  // report at once and a pointer leaving one must not release the hold a
  // keyboard has on another. Clamped at zero so a leave without its enter,
  // which is what a slide going inert mid-hover would send, cannot latch it.
