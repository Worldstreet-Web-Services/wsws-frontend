// Reads. `me` tells us whether the player carries the creator role that
// POST /streams demands; the stream read is how the panel reflects a status
// the service changed underneath us, such as the orphan reaper ending a
// stream after the host disconnected.
// `streams` is the discovery read: given a deep-link ref it answers with every
// live stream pointing at that activity, which is how a second player finds
// the broadcast their opponent already started. `speaker-requests` is the
// host's pending queue, and `speaker-requests/me` is the guest's own request,
// which carries the publishing credentials once it is approved.
